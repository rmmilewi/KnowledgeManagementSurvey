Hello,

This email is an invitation to participate in a survey of Trilinos developers being conducted by the Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software (IDEAS) team, an arm of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). The aim of IDEAS-ECP is to improve scientific productivity by qualitatively changing scientific software developer productivity.

The purpose of this survey is to study the knowledge management practices of scientific software developers, that is, to understand the kinds of knowledge that are created and shared and their relationship to the software project. The questions ask about the work you do, how you coordinate and collaborate with others, and any obstacles you may face.

Only the researchers involved in this study will see your responses. Your participation in this study is voluntary. If you do not want to participate, please disregard this email. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Reed Milewicz (1426), the PI for this survey.
