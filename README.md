This repository contains a copy of materials used in the 2018 paper "Coordinating Expertise in Large-Scale Scientific Software Projects: A Case Study". The paper was written by Reed Milewicz and Elaine Raybourn of Sandia National Laboratories and prepared for WSSSPE'18. Here we provide copies of the developer's survey, recruitment materials, anonymized survey responses, and review board approval documents.
